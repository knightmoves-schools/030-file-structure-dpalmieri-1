Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Justify the selection of specific control structures when tradeoffs involve implementation, readability, and program performance, and explain the benefits and drawbacks of choices made. (3A-AP-15) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Decompose problems into smaller components through systematic analysis, using constructs such as procedures, modules, and/or objects. (3A-AP-17) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
